# CS 300 - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains artifacts from my CS 300 course, focusing on data structures and algorithm efficiency. Included are:
- Project One: Runtime and memory analysis of different data structures.
- Project Two: A C++ program that sorts and prints a list of computer science courses in alphanumeric order.

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal of these projects was to design a program that efficiently manages course information for ABC University. The system needed to store, retrieve, and print courses using various data structures, ensuring quick lookup and sorting.

### How did you approach the problem?
Since data structures impact efficiency, I analyzed vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BSTs) to determine their strengths and weaknesses for different operations. I then implemented a BST to store and retrieve course data in sorted order.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks?
Some challenges included handling file input errors, ensuring case-insensitive course lookups, and optimizing BST traversal. I resolved these by debugging edge cases, refining my approach to string manipulation, and testing different file parsing methods.

### How has this work expanded your approach to software design?
This project reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure based on problem constraints. It also highlighted how Big O analysis directly impacts real-world performance.

### How has your work evolved the way you write programs?
I now focus more on maintainability and readability, ensuring my code is modular, well-commented, and adaptable. Structuring functions properly and handling input errors gracefully are key takeaways that will benefit future projects.
